### Introduction
PopCorner is an app created to connect movie enthusiasts in a community-based app, users can securely create a profile or log-in, register interests, create and join communities and events and use Real-Time group chats to communicate with fellow film enthusiasts.


### Technologies used
The front-end of the application is designed using React Native and styled using React Native Paper and NativeWind (React Native equivalent of TailWind). The user authentication and sign-up uses Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign-up using their email address
and password. Firebase Cloud Messaging and Gifted Chat were used to create the real-time group chat section of the app, for each community created there is a real-time group chat generated that is associated to that community. Users can join a community and see the group chats they have access to on the 'chats' tab.
